# JS30 Hold Shift & Check Multiple Checkboxes
Exercise 10 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials.

As Wes said, this one took me a few goes to understand. I was hesitant on what bonus feature I could add with success on this one. About 4 hours later I was able to have the checked item move to the bottom of the list as seen on the Apple Notes App among others. This works for both single items and the shift multi selected items.

I used setTimeout() for the single item selection so that it didn't jump immediately down to the bottom of the list before the user had a chance to select other items.
